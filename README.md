# Wrist Aficionado Competitor Intelligence

A weekly competitor intelligence tool for Wrist Aficionado, built on Next.js + GitHub Actions + Claude API.

## What It Does

- Tracks 5+ luxury watch competitor websites
- Each week, fetches their sitemaps and detects new pages built
- Ingests SEMrush CSV exports for backlinks and keyword changes
- Uses Claude to generate a written weekly intelligence report
- Reports are committed to the repo and viewable in a Next.js dashboard
- Hosted free on Vercel Hobby + GitHub Actions

## Architecture

```
GitHub Repo (this) ──► GitHub Actions (weekly cron, generates report)
       │                            │
       │                            ▼
       │                   reports/2026-04-30.md (committed back)
       │
       └──► Vercel (auto-deploys, serves dashboard at wrist-aficionado-intel.vercel.app)
```

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
# Fill in ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and GITHUB_TOKEN at minimum
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## Weekly Workflow

1. **Export SEMrush CSVs** for each competitor (backlinks, position changes). Drop them in `data/csv/YYYY-MM-DD/`
2. **Wait for the Monday cron** (or trigger manually from `/run-report`)
3. **GitHub Actions runs:**
   - Fetches each competitor's sitemap
   - Diffs against last week's sitemap
   - Reads the uploaded CSVs
   - Calls Claude to write the report
   - Commits the report to `reports/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
4. **View the report** at `/reports/latest` on the deployed dashboard

## Deployment

1. Push this repo to GitHub
2. Connect the repo at vercel.com (free Hobby tier)
3. Add environment variables in Vercel: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_OWNER`, `GITHUB_REPO`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
4. Add the same secrets to GitHub: Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
